I am trying to write tasks for a machine learning system.

Here is the format:

answers = ["microwave", "countertop", "sink basin", "shelf", "toaster", "dining table", "cabinet", "drawer", "stove burner", "garbage can", "coffee machine", "fridge"]

"""You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a microwave, countertop, sink basin, fridge, shelf, toaster, dining table, cabinet, drawer, stove burner, garbage can, and coffee machine.
Your task is to: put lettuce on the dining table.
> go to fridge"""

Write a tasks and actions for each item in the kitchen. 

In the above situation, the task is

Your task is to: put a clean lettuce on dining table.

and the action is 

> go to fridge"""

write the task so that the task location isn't specified in the task
